# Tightrope

Tightrope is a calender based mental health application designed to give users a visual representation of their work-life balance and pursuade user to make an informed decision to better their mental health.

This project was a senior capstone project for the computer science & enginnering department at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/cse). The team members for this project were Mackenzie Z, Sahil P, Demitri B, Michael D, and Cooper F.

This project is an [angular](https://angular.io) based UI for the front end and uses a Django based python backend ([TightBackend](https://github.com/pyakures/TightropeBackend) - Credits to the [original source code](https://github.com/mdoradocode/TightropeBackend)).

Note: This project is deprecated and no longer maintained by the developers. This might result in dependencies that are no longer supported or accessible.

## Building

For setting up Tightrope for use on a local machine, download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone the repository to a local disk space using Github.

Once Node.js and the repository are on the local machine, open the directory of the repository and type: npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps

## Running

To run Tighrope on your local machine, run ng serve.

This should compile the webpage and run a local server. You can view the webpage at localhost:4200/login.

The calendar can be viewed at localhost:4200/home.

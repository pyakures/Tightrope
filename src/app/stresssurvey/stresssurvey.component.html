    <h1>Stress Survey</h1><br>
    <h2>How have you been doing lately?</h2>
    <h3>Perceived Stress Scale</h3>
    <h4>The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain way. Although some of the questions are similar, 
      there are differences between them and you should treat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. 
      That is, don’t try to count up the number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like a reasonable estimate.</h4><br>
    <h4>The final score for this assessment will contribute to the Stress Level.</h4>

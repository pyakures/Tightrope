    <p>There are a variety of scheduler applications that manage the day-to-day operations of people's livesâ€”Tightrope is different. It places emphasis on mental wellness and prioritizes an optimized work-life balance. 
    </p>
    <p>
    To mantain a healthy work:life balance, individuals must be active in developing their mental wellness and understanding common stresses in their lives.
    Because of this, the developers of Tightrope have built the application on the foundation of three principles: Intentionality, 
    Education, and Mindfulness.

        <p><i>Tightrope</i> initially appears as a regular scheduler, equiped with adding, editing, and deleting events.
          In addition to these basic functionalities, the events then can be categorized into leisure vs. work with an associated stress level for that event.</p>
        <p>This distintion is a unique way to categorize events in which users can then focus on being intentional during their leisure time 
        and have a quick view as to the quantitative balance of leisure vs. work activities. </p>

            <p>The stress forecasting component takes in multiple factors from the user's current scheduled week and surevey data and predicts the stress for the subsequent weeks.
            This information is valuable because it then can be used to optimize the user's future weeks. To optimize a user's schedule, the machine learning model would generate
            a balanced schedule of work obligations and leisure activities to best reduce the stress level compared to the prior week. </p>

              The data collected is then used to optimize future schedules for the user.</p>
               <p>The key portion of this feature is that the surevey is developed with user simplicity and availability in mind. 
              We know that nobody wants to fill out a 30 part questionaire every day, so we balanced the cost of convience with the cost of accuracy to develop our survey frequency and questions.</p>

            The caveat is that occationally trying to find a leisurely activity adds to the overall stress of an individual instead of diminishing it.</p>
            <p>This is where the Event Recommendation feature comes in.</p>
